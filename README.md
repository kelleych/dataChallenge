# A Story of Felon Disenfranchisement
Team TBA: Proposition 17

Data Challenge: We chose Proposition 17, an amendment to restore voting rights to people on parole. We were surprised to see how restrictive California's current policies were given the liberal nature of the state. We were also surprised to see the extreme variations in felon voting rights from states that permanently ban current and previous felons from voting to states that allow current prisoners to vote. Our research question was aimed at looking into factors related to suppressive voting policies.
